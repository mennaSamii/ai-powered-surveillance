YOLO Algorithm

- YOLO stand for You Only Look Once
- YOLO is an effective real-time object recognition algorithm
-  Cars such as Teslas use the YOLO algorithm and CNNs
- ----------------------------------------------------
- Most of the computer vision projects needs a detection algorithms
-  YOLO is the best and fastest detection algorithm (1fps in real life detection)
- Check the stages detector screenshoot 
- Classification: knowing what is the object
- Localization: knowing where is the object 
- classification and localization: knowing where is the object and what is it 
-  Object Detection: classification of different objects
- Instance Segmentation: Classification and Localization of different objects 
- Intersection over union (IoU) : It is used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of bounding boxes
- intersection over union calculation: attached
- Correct if IoU >= 0.5
